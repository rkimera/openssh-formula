    ## Eliminate key exchange protocols that use NIST curves, have too
    ## small a DH modulus, or use an insecure hash function, while
    ## still maintaining a degree of backward compatibility.

    ## Explicitly enable public key authentication.
    PubkeyAuthentication: yes

    ## Disable the DSA and ECDSA server authentication algorithms,
    ## which depend on the quality/integrity of the PRNG to prevent
    ## key recovery attacks.  DSA also requires 1024-bit keys, which
    ## are too small.

    ## Eliminate broken ciphers, key sizes less than 128 bits, and
    ## block ciphers with block sizes smaller than 128 bits.  Prefer
    ## AE modes but allow CTR for backwards compatibility (CTR with
    ## Encrypt-then-MAC begin provably secure), and prefer
    ## ChaCha20+Poly1305 over the others because it encrypts message
    ## sizes (which prevents certain kinds of encrypted traffic
    ## analysis attacks).
